Notifications Addon TODOs

* Add Notification distribution to other plug-ins.
  Concept: Plugins would register as consumers of "intents"
  Notifications would be sent to those plugins (or user presented with a selector)
  Unconsumed notifications would default to a user facing display.
    Work Notes: May be able to do this via an observer and custom events
        Probably should build off of the webintent model.
        There's an issue with the jetpack/sdk and how it creates observers (see main.js)

* finish up UI panel for pause/delete notifications.
    (delete works, pause does not.)
    Need to factor in pause on server (helps with pause sync coordination
        and loss)
Ideally, the UI elements would be done by UX team and included. 
That's probably not going to happen.

(See PUSH server code for additional work items.)
